# Vending Machine Embedded System

## Introduction
This project is an embedded system for a vending machine, designed around the PIC16882F microcontroller. This software handles fundamental vending machine operations such as coin input, product dispensation, and inventory management.

## Requirements
- Hardware: PIC16882F microcontroller and vending machine components
- Software: MPLAB X IDE, XC8 Compiler

## Running the Firmware
To install the firmware, you need to compile the source code using the MPLAB X IDE and XC8 Compiler, and then flash the compiled hex file to the PIC16882F microcontroller. Please refer to the Microchip website for detailed instructions.

## Known Issues
Please note that this version of the software is not currently building successfully due to some unresolved bugs. We are actively working to rectify these issues. Your patience is greatly appreciated.

## Observations and Thoughts
Building an embedded system for a vending machine has been a valuable learning experience. Working with the PIC16882F microcontroller has given us insights into the design and implementation of embedded systems in a real-world application. While we have encountered some challenges, we are continuously learning and improving the system.

## Time Spent on the Project
Work on this project is ongoing. We are committed to resolving the current build issues and enhancing the overall functionality of the vending machine system.
